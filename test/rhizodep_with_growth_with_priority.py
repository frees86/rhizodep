# Parameters for growth respiration:
#-----------------------------------
# Growth yield (in mol of CO2 per mol of C used for biomass):
yield_growth = 0.8
# => Explanation: We use the value proposed by Thornley and Cannell (2000)

# Parameters for maintenance respiration:
#----------------------------------------
# Maximal maintenance respiration (in mol of CO2 per g of biomass per s):
resp_maintenance_max = 4.1e-6/20/12.01*0.44

# Affinity constant for maintenance respiration (in mol of hexose per g of biomass):

# Permeability coefficient (in g of biomass per m2 per s):
Pmax_apex = expected_exudation_efflux /(expected_C_hexose_root-expected_C_hexose_soil)/100.
